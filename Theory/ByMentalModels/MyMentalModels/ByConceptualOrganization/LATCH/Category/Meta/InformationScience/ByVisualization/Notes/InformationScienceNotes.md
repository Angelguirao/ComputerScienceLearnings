# Information Science

## Overview
Information science is the overarching field that studies information processes, focusing on how information is created, organized, stored, retrieved, and utilized across natural and artificial systems.

## Key Principles
- **Universality**: Information science spans symbolic and non-symbolic forms of information.
- **Interdisciplinarity**: Combines insights from fields like computer science, cognitive science, and biology.
- **Representation**: Central to its study is how information is encoded and decoded.

## Topics of Interest
- **Natural Information Processes**: Found in ecosystems, genetics, and neural systems.
- **Artificial Information Processes**: Algorithms, databases, and communication systems.
- **Human-Centric Applications**: Knowledge management, information retrieval, and user interfaces.

## Relationship to Other Fields
- Acts as the umbrella field encompassing **Computing** and **Informatics**.
- Provides theoretical foundations for practical applications in technology and science.

# Meta: Exploring the Foundations of Computer Science

The **Meta** section delves into the conceptual and philosophical underpinnings of computer science. It serves as a space for examining how core ideas about information, computation, and automation relate to broader inquiries into connection, meaning, and technological potential. 

## Topics:
- **Foundations of Information**: A deep dive into the relationship between information and symbols, and how representation affects processing.
- **Information Science**: Understanding information processes at a universal scale.
- **Computing**: Differentiating between information and symbol processing, and exploring the role of entities (biological, artificial, quantum) in computation.
- **Informatics**: Investigating automated symbol processing and its balance between domain-specific applications and general-purpose computing.
- **Relationships Between Fields**: Synthesizing how these foundational fields interact, with implications for computer science and interdisciplinary studies.

These explorations frame computer science as more than just a technical disciplineâ€”they illuminate its role as a generative practice for understanding the world through information.

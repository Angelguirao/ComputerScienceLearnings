# Computing

## Overview
Computing involves the processing of information or symbols, depending on the nature of the system performing the computation. It serves as the operational core of information processing in both natural and artificial systems.

## Key Distinctions
- **Information Processing**: Broadly refers to how systems (e.g., brains, ecosystems) process patterns and signals.
- **Symbol Processing**: A specific form of computing that manipulates discrete symbols, characteristic of classical computers.

## Forms of Computing
1. **Classical Computing**: Symbolic manipulation through formal rules (e.g., binary operations).
2. **Neural Computing**: Pattern recognition and signal processing in biological or artificial neural networks.
3. **Quantum Computing**: Exploits quantum states to process information in ways classical systems cannot.

## Insights
- Computing bridges theoretical frameworks (e.g., algorithms) and practical implementations (e.g., hardware).
- The nature of the "computing entity" determines whether computation is symbolic or non-symbolic.

# Informatics

## Overview
Informatics is the study and application of **automated symbol processing** using computational tools. It focuses on managing and analyzing information to derive insights or solve practical problems.

## Key Features
- **Automated Symbol Processing**: Uses general-purpose computers to manipulate symbols according to defined rules.
- **Applications Across Domains**: While often associated with domain-specific fields (e.g., bioinformatics, health informatics), its principles are generalizable.

## Insights
- Informatics bridges theoretical computing principles with practical applications.
- It thrives on adapting general-purpose computing tools to domain-specific challenges, though it also supports universal information management tasks.

## Relation to Other Fields
- **Computer Science**: Provides the theoretical and technical foundation for informatics.
- **Information Science**: Informatics operationalizes the study of information processes in practical contexts.

**Next Steps:** Investigate how informatics scales between general-purpose and domain-specific applications, and how it leverages automated tools for symbolic and non-symbolic data processing.

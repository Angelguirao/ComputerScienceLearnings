# Foundations of Information

## Overview
Information is a fundamental concept that transcends disciplines. It serves as the basis for processes in nature, technology, and human thought. This file explores the nature of information, its representation, and its role in computation.

## Key Concepts
- **Information**: Meaningful data or patterns that reduce uncertainty or convey knowledge.
- **Symbols**: Representations of information in a tangible form (e.g., binary code, written language).
- **Representation**: The act of encoding information into symbols for manipulation or communication.

## Insights
- The moment information is represented, symbols often become necessary to process, store, or transmit it.
- Not all information is symbolic; non-symbolic forms (e.g., neural activity, quantum states) are critical in certain systems.

## Applications
- Understanding the foundational role of information is crucial for disciplines like computer science, neuroscience, and quantum physics.

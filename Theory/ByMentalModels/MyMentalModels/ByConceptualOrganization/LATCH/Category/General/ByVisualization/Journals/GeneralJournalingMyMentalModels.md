Today was a day of refinement and reflection. We worked on crafting a more comprehensive structure for the **Computer Science Learnings** repository, blending logical organization with a deeper appreciation for narrative and beauty in the learning process.

I also watched the [Node.js documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LB8KwiiUGy0), which offered a fascinating look into the origins and evolution of this runtime

Today was a day of delving into the origins, history, and future of computing.

I watched a video titled [Doc of the Day: Tracing the Path of Computer Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KHuSw0W6OA) and a video titled [Future Computers Will Be Radically Different (Analog Computing)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVsUOuSjvcg&t=274s). I also reread the first chapter of the book [Ideas That Created the Future" (MIT Press)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LB8KwiiUGy0), where Aristotle's logic groundwork for modern computer science is discussed and listen to a [Brendan Eich Podcast Episode by Lex Fridman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krB0enBeSiE).

The analog computing video emphasized its potential in AI and machine learning due to its significant energy efficiency and real-time processing capabilities. This exploration highlighted how analog systems, despite challenges like noise and limited precision, might play a pivotal role in the future of computing, blending the strengths of digital and analog technologies.

The documentary on the evolution of computer science traced information technology from its origins with writing to modern advancements. Key insights included the Jacquard loom's abstraction through punched cards, Alan Turing's general-purpose computing concept, and Claude Shannon's quantification of information using bits. The film also covered Moore's Law and the internet's transformative effect on information communication. Looking ahead, it mentioned DNA computing and quantum bits (qubits).

I also listened to the first part of the interview with Brendan Eich, the creator of JavaScript and co-founder of Mozilla and Brave. Eich shared insights into the origin and evolution of JavaScript, the intense browser wars of the early internet, and his role in developing Firefox and founding Brave, emphasizing privacy and security.

- **Information Science**: Understanding information processes at a universal scale.
- **Computing**: Differentiating between information and symbol processing, and exploring the role of entities (biological, artificial, quantum) in computation.
- **Informatics**: Investigating automated symbol processing and its balance between domain-specific applications and general-purpose computing.
- **Relationships Between Fields**: Synthesizing how these foundational fields interact, with implications for computer science and interdisciplinary studies.

These explorations frame computer science as more than just a technical disciplineâ€”they illuminate its role as a generative practice for understanding the world through information.

# Foundations of Information

## Overview
Information is a fundamental concept that transcends disciplines. It serves as the basis for processes in nature, technology, and human thought. This file explores the nature of information, its representation, and its role in computation.

## Key Concepts
- **Information**: Meaningful data or patterns that reduce uncertainty or convey knowledge.
- **Symbols**: Representations of information in a tangible form (e.g., binary code, written language).
- **Representation**: The act of encoding information into symbols for manipulation or communication.

## Insights
- The moment information is represented, symbols often become necessary to process, store, or transmit it.
- Not all information is symbolic; non-symbolic forms (e.g., neural activity, quantum states) are critical in certain systems.

## Applications
- Understanding the foundational role of information is crucial for disciplines like computer science, neuroscience, and quantum physics.

**Next Steps:** Investigate how information science bridges natural and artificial systems, and explore its role in defining modern computing paradigms.

# Computing

## Overview
Computing involves the processing of information or symbols, depending on the nature of the system performing the computation. It serves as the operational core of information processing in both natural and artificial systems.

## Key Distinctions
- **Information Processing**: Broadly refers to how systems (e.g., brains, ecosystems) process patterns and signals.
- **Symbol Processing**: A specific form of computing that manipulates discrete symbols, characteristic of classical computers.

## Forms of Computing
1. **Classical Computing**: Symbolic manipulation through formal rules (e.g., binary operations).
2. **Neural Computing**: Pattern recognition and signal processing in biological or artificial neural networks.
3. **Quantum Computing**: Exploits quantum states to process information in ways classical systems cannot.

## Insights
- Computing bridges theoretical frameworks (e.g., algorithms) and practical implementations (e.g., hardware).
- The nature of the "computing entity" determines whether computation is symbolic or non-symbolic.

**Next Steps:** Explore how computing shifts between symbolic and non-symbolic paradigms depending on the entity performing the processing, and its implications for AI and natural systems.

# Informatics

## Overview
Informatics is the study and application of **automated symbol processing** using computational tools. It focuses on managing and analyzing information to derive insights or solve practical problems.

## Key Features
- **Automated Symbol Processing**: Uses general-purpose computers to manipulate symbols according to defined rules.
- **Applications Across Domains**: While often associated with domain-specific fields (e.g., bioinformatics, health informatics), its principles are generalizable.

## Insights
- Informatics bridges theoretical computing principles with practical applications.
- It thrives on adapting general-purpose computing tools to domain-specific challenges, though it also supports universal information management tasks.

## Relation to Other Fields
- **Computer Science**: Provides the theoretical and technical foundation for informatics.
- **Information Science**: Informatics operationalizes the study of information processes in practical contexts.

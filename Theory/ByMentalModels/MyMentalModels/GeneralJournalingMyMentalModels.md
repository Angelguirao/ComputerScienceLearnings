Today was a day of refinement and reflection. We worked on crafting a more comprehensive structure for the **Computer Science Learnings** repository, blending logical organization with a deeper appreciation for narrative and beauty in the learning process. Incorporating **LATCH**, **DSRP**, and the **Socratic Method** as conceptual frameworks made me realize how versatile and interconnected these tools are for structuring knowledge.

I also watched the [Node.js documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LB8KwiiUGy0), which offered a fascinating look into the origins and evolution of this runtime. The story of how a simple idea grew into a transformative tool in modern web development reminded me of the power of collaboration, adaptability, and curiosity. Itâ€™s a testament to how technology can reflect human creativity and the importance of staying open to new ideas.

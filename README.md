# Computer Science Learnings

## Purpose

**Information** lies at the heart of my philosophy of life. It is through information that relationships—between people, systems, and ideas—are built and sustained. Computer science embodies this potential, serving not merely as a technical discipline but as a generative practice for creating meaningful connections. By viewing information’s primary purpose as connection rather than static truth, computational thinking transforms into a broader, more nuanced exploration of interconnectedness.

## Approach

This repository will serve as the backbone of my journey into the world of computer science. Through a blended approach of **top-down theoretical exploration** and **bottom-up practical implementation**, I aim to build a comprehensive understanding of computational systems, tools, and philosophies. Guided by **self-directed learning**, this space will evolve as both a personal learning resource and a reflection of my broader exploration of technology and its relational nature.

### Conceptual Organization Frameworks

This repository employs three primary conceptual organization frameworks to structure and analyze information:

1. **LATCH**:
   - **Location**: Organize information spatially or geographically.
   - **Alphabet**: Arrange concepts in alphabetical order.
   - **Time**: Sequence information chronologically.
   - **Category**: Group similar items together.
   - **Hierarchy**: Prioritize information by importance or rank.

2. **DSRP (Distinctions, Systems, Relationships, Perspectives)**:
   - **Distinctions**: Identify differences between concepts or ideas.
   - **Systems**: Examine parts and wholes within a framework.
   - **Relationships**: Explore interactions between elements.
   - **Perspectives**: Consider different viewpoints and contexts.

3. **Socratic Method**:
   - **Clarification**: Define and refine the meaning of concepts.
   - **Assumptions**: Examine underlying premises or beliefs.
   - **Evidence**: Evaluate the basis of claims and arguments.
   - **Alternative Perspectives**: Explore other possible interpretations.
   - **Implications**: Analyze the consequences of ideas or decisions.

These frameworks guide the organization and analysis of information within the repository, fostering structured exploration and critical thinking.

### Explanation of Visualization

Each unit of every component within the conceptual organization frameworks (**LATCH**, **DSRP**, and **Socratic Method**) will be visually represented using the following tools:

1. **Journals**:
   - Capture reflective thoughts, personal insights, and learning narratives.
   - Provide space for free-form exploration and metaphorical connections.
   - Serve as a bridge between structured learning and the beauty of the learning process.

2. **Notes**:
   - Provide concise explanations or summaries.
   - Useful for quick reference and highlighting key points.

3. **Outlines**:
   - Present structured, hierarchical representations.
   - Break down complex topics into manageable sections.

4. **Matrices**:
   - Enable comparative analysis of relationships.
   - Highlight similarities and differences between elements.

5. **Mind Maps**:
   - Illustrate connections and relationships between concepts.
   - Provide a high-level overview of interconnected ideas.

6. **Network Diagrams**:
   - Represent systems and their interdependencies.
   - Visualize dynamic interactions in complex networks.

7. **Flowcharts**:
   - Depict sequential processes or decision-making steps.
   - Ideal for mapping workflows and cause-effect relationships.

8. **Q&A (Interactive Format)**:
   - Facilitate active engagement and recall through Socratic questioning.
   - Useful for flashcards or interactive learning tools.

These visualization methods ensure that every conceptual unit is accessible through multiple perspectives, enhancing comprehension, retention, and practical application.

## Time Management

This project is a **lifelong pursuit**, as computer science lies at the core of my philosophy of life. However, to stay accountable and maintain concrete progress, I’ve set a goal to achieve **10,000 hours of independent learning outside of work**. 

I will track my progress using tools like time tracking and periodic reviews. You can access the time-tracking tool here: [Time Tracker](https://app.clockify.me/dashboard)

## **Inspiration**

This repository draws inspiration from thinkers, projects, and resources that emphasize **understanding over abstraction** and **exploration over rote learning**:

- **[Blub Paradox](https://www.benkuhn.net/blub/)** by Ben Kuhn: A reflection on the limits of understanding when confined by abstractions.
- **[Computers Can Be Understood](https://blog.nelhage.com/post/computers-can-be-understood/)**: An argument for learning the underlying principles of systems to achieve mastery.
- **[We Have Used Too Many Levels of Abstraction](https://unixdigest.com/articles/we-have-used-too-many-levels-of-abstractions-and-now-the-future-looks-bleak.html)**: A critique of excessive abstraction in modern software development.
- **[The MIT Challenge](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/)** by Scott Young: A journey of rapid, self-directed learning through the MIT Computer Science curriculum.
- **[Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)**: A roadmap to transition from a surface-level familiarity with high-level tools to a profound comprehension of computer science principles.

These resources underscore the value of mastering the **fundamentals** and breaking through layers of abstraction to connect deeply with computational systems.

## Other Motivations

Beyond the primary purpose of exploring interconnectedness, this repository is also motivated by:

- **Learning about information in a comprehensive way**: Developing a deep understanding of information as a fundamental concept, including its processes, representations, and connections across diverse domains. This involves exploring information science, computing, and the philosophical implications of information as a unifying thread in human knowledge and systems.

- **Exploring the profound potential of AGI**: Delving into how AGI might transform humanity’s future, fostering deeper connection, ethical progress, and human flourishing. By reimagining how we live and work, I aim to uncover how AGI might free humanity from the constraints of mandatory labor, enabling more time for creativity, learning, and meaningful connection.

- **Embracing self-hosted, open-source distributed technologies**: Investigating technologies that ensure privacy, security, and autonomy in the information society, fostering empowerment in a world increasingly shaped by data and connectivity. This includes understanding the risks posed by excessive abstraction in technology. Over-reliance on abstraction layers can lead to diminished comprehension and potential vulnerabilities.

## Integration with the Cognitive Compass System

This repository is not a static resource; it is designed to evolve alongside my broader **Cognitive Compass** project. As I refine and develop the Cognitive Compass system—a platform for capturing, abstracting, and exploring interconnected ideas—this repository will play a pivotal role in supporting and integrating computer science knowledge. 

The integration may take one of the following forms:
1. **Direct Integration**: The repository's contents could be directly merged into the Cognitive Compass system, functioning as a specialized module for computational knowledge.
2. **Loose Coupling**: It may remain a separate repository, linked to the Cognitive Compass via dynamic data queries, APIs, or shared knowledge graphs.
3. **Hybrid Approach**: Some parts (e.g., theoretical notes) might be migrated, while others (e.g., project-specific implementations) remain distinct.

This adaptive approach ensures the repository remains aligned with the evolving goals of both my personal learning and the Cognitive Compass system.

## Final Note

This repository is a living document of my commitment to understanding computer science as a generative practice of connection, growth, and discovery. By studying computation in-depth, I aim to build meaningful relationships between ideas, technologies, and people, embracing the transformative potential of information. As it evolves and integrates with the Cognitive Compass system, it will become not just a learning resource but an active component of a larger vision for interconnected exploration and discovery.

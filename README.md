## Purpose

**Information** lies at the heart of my philosophy of life. It is through information that relationships—between people, systems, and ideas—are built and sustained. Computer science embodies this potential, serving not merely as a technical discipline but as a generative practice for creating meaningful connections. By viewing information’s primary purpose as connection rather than static truth, computational thinking transforms into a broader, more nuanced exploration of interconnectedness.

## Approach

This repository will serve as the backbone of my journey into the world of computer science. Through a blended approach of **top-down theoretical exploration** and **bottom-up practical implementation**, I aim to build a comprehensive understanding of computational systems, tools, and philosophies. Guided by **self-directed learning**, this space will evolve as both a personal learning resource and a reflection of my broader exploration of technology and its relational nature.

## Integration with the Cognitive Compass System

This repository is not a static resource; it is designed to evolve alongside my broader **Cognitive Compass** project. As I refine and develop the Cognitive Compass system—a platform for capturing, abstracting, and exploring interconnected ideas—this repository will play a pivotal role in supporting and integrating computer science knowledge. 

The integration may take one of the following forms:
1. **Direct Integration**: The repository's contents could be directly merged into the Cognitive Compass system, functioning as a specialized module for computational knowledge.
2. **Loose Coupling**: It may remain a separate repository, linked to the Cognitive Compass via dynamic data queries, APIs, or shared knowledge graphs.
3. **Hybrid Approach**: Some parts (e.g., theoretical notes) might be migrated, while others (e.g., project-specific implementations) remain distinct.

This adaptive approach ensures the repository remains aligned with the evolving goals of both my personal learning and the Cognitive Compass system.

   - The Projects folder will house practical applications as the repository evolves.

3. **Leverage Resources**:
   - Use the Resources folder for additional books, courses, and tools to deepen your understanding.

## Other Motivations

Beyond the primary purpose of exploring interconnectedness, this repository is also motivated by:

- **Exploring the profound potential of AGI**: Delving into how AGI might transform humanity’s future, fostering deeper connection, ethical progress, and human flourishing. By reimagining how we live and work, I aim to uncover how AGI might free humanity from the constraints of mandatory labor, enabling more time for creativity, learning, and meaningful connection.

- **Embracing self-hosted, open-source distributed technologies**: Investigating technologies that ensure privacy, security, and autonomy in the information society, fostering empowerment in a world increasingly shaped by data and connectivity. This includes understanding the risks posed by excessive abstraction in technology. Over-reliance on abstraction layers can lead to diminished comprehension and potential vulnerabilities.


## Final Note

This repository is a living document of my commitment to understanding computer science as a generative practice of connection, growth, and discovery. By studying computation in-depth, I aim to build meaningful relationships between ideas, technologies, and people, embracing the transformative potential of information. As it evolves and integrates with the Cognitive Compass system, it will become not just a learning resource but an active component of a larger vision for interconnected exploration and discovery.
